My humble ruby solutions on CodeWars.

I started coding in July 2022 and regularly doing katas on codewars to improve since.

The solutions I propose are the one I sent and are not refactored.
When I used external resources I try as much as possible to mention it as a comment.

I created this repo as an accessible base for myself and to showcase my code to potential recruiters / clients.
